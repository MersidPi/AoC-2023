Firstly I parsed all workflows and parts to make things easier to work with. After that, we go 
for each part, through workflows according to rules in those workflows, this structure looks like 
a tree. If we end up on A, we put the part in the sum and so on.

For part 2, we have paths through workflows that lead to couple letter As. For each path we have 
constraints for x, m, a and s, so we need to make valid ranges for those letters. Then for each 
path we simply multiply number of values in each range and that way we'll get number of combinations 
of x, m, a, s (different parts). Sum them all up and that's the final answer.
