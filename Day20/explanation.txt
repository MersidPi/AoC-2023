Firstly we can parse all modules to make things easier. Then we make a loop that simulates the 
push of a button. We can put in a queue every pulse that every module sends, because it's a 
LIFO structure, taht way we process pulses in correct order. we simulate pulses propagation 
through modules and just count low and high pulses. In the end we just multiply those 2 counters.

In the second part, after analysing input and seeing that only one conjunction named lb can send 
pulse to final module rx, I got this idea. All inputs to lb need to be high pulse, because only 
then it will send a low pulse to rx. So we can start pressing the button, and count how many 
number of button presses are needed to get each individual input of conjunction lb to be high. 
This happens periodically for each input, so the least number of button presses to get all 
inputs to be high is least common multiple of those numbers. And that is the result to part 2.

PS: Original example for input doesn't work beacuse real in real input modules only have 2 letters,
and for part 2 example for input doesn't have rx module.
