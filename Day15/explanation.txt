For part 1 it's pretty straightforward how to solve it, we just follow the instructions for 
calculating hash and add it to the sum for every string.

For part 2 we first determine the hash for the name so we know to which box it belongs, and 
if we need to add the lens, remove it from the box or update it. We repeat this for every 
string and in the end we calculate the sum according to task.
